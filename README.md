Team Visionx 🤟 – Smart Navigation & Object Detection AssistantEmpowering the Visually Impaired through AI-Driven Spatial Awareness.📖 Table of ContentsOverviewKey FeaturesHow It WorksInstallationDeployment (Streamlit Cloud)Tech StackFuture RoadmapLicense🔍 OverviewTeam Visionx is an assistive technology web application designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings. Using a custom-trained YOLO model, the app identifies hazards, moving objects, and clear paths, providing real-time Smart Navigation instructions via voice feedback.The goal is simple: Convert visual data into actionable audio guidance.✨ Key FeaturesSmart Navigation Brain: Beyond just naming objects, the app calculates object positions (Left, Center, Right) and provides instructions (e.g., "Car on the left. Move right.").Priority Detection: Danger classes (knives, fire, guns) are prioritized in the audio queue over standard objects.Triple Input Support: Works with live Webcams, uploaded images, and video files.Voice Feedback System: Built-in speech synthesis with a smart cooldown to prevent "audio clutter."Dynamic Dashboard: Real-time confidence sliders and toggleable settings for a personalized experience.🧠 How It WorksThe app divides the camera frame into three vertical sectors:Left: $0\%$ to $33\%$ of frame width.Center: $33\%$ to $66\%$ of frame width (Triggering "Stop" commands).Right: $66\%$ to $100\%$ of frame width.If a "Danger" or "Moving" object enters the Center zone, the app immediately issues a "Stop" or "Move" instruction based on the clearest path available.🛠 Installation1.
